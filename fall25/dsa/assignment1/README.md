# Maze Solver ‚Äî DSA Assignment 1 (00000502082)

## Overview
This project implements a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** based Maze Solver in **C++**.


## ‚öôÔ∏è Compilation and Execution
Make sure that you are in the same directory as all of the files

### **1. Compilation**
Use any C++17-compatible compiler (e.g., MinGW g++, Code::Blocks, or Linux g++).  
Run the following command in the project directory:

```bash
g++ main_00000502082.cpp Maze_00000502082.cpp Solver_00000502082.cpp -o maze_app 
```

### **2. Execution**
Run the program with:

```bash
./maze_app filename.csv
```

If no filename is given, the program defaults to reading from input.csv.
Some sample grid patterns are already given as easy/hard/medium.csv

The output maze is written to solved_output.csv and parent array is written to parent_array.csv
